# CEASER-CIPHER-ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION
This project implements Caesar Cipher encoding and decoding for a single byte using an 8-bit input and a user-defined key. It supports both uppercase and lowercase ASCII characters with wrap-around. The design is simulated in Logisim Evolution and implemented on a Basys3 FPGA board.
